    <p class="description">
    Peanut butter-filled crackers dipped in chocolate and decorated with candy sprinkles are a decadent treat to
    have on hand. Store cookies between layers of waxed paper in cool, dry place, or in the refrigerator. These freeze well.
    </p>

    <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup creamy or chunky peanut butter</li>
        <li>2 pounds chocolate almond bark, broken into pieces</li>
        <li>80 buttery round crackers</li>
        <li>2 ¼ ounces colored candy sprinkles (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread approximately 1 teaspoon peanut butter onto each cracker half. Press peanut butter sides together to form 40
        peanut butter-filled sandwich cookies.</li>

        <li>Melt almond bark in the top of a double boiler over hot, but not boiling, water. Reduce heat and keep melted chocolate
        in top of double boiler over simmering water.</li>

        <li>Dip each sandwich cookie into the melted chocolate, allowing excess to drain back into pot.</li>

        <li>Place coated cookies onto waxed paper and immediately sprinkle with candy sprinkles so they adhere to the melted chocolate.</li>

        <li>Place cookies in the refrigerator until chocolate has set, about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
